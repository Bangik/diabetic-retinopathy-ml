# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using GLCM and SVM Method

Develop with Python >= 3.8

Using [Aptos 2019 DR Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection)

This project will use Gray Level Co-Occurence Matrix (GLCM) feature extraction and maybe with area feature extraction also to classify diabetic retinopathy images into 5 classes (No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, PDR) using Vector Support Machine (SVM)

In order to obtain high accuracy, in this project there are blood vessels, microaneurysm, and exudate segmentation. The results of this segmentation will be carried out by a feature extraction process with GLCM or also with area
